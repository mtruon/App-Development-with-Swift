# App Development with Swift (Everyone can Code - Apple)
This repo contains the end of lesson projects I've worked on from the  "App Development with Swift" textbook by Everyone Can Code/Apple.

Each completed project is accompanied by an added personal extension or stretch goal. I used the projects as a vision and extended their features to learn about more items that I'm interested in.

The purpose of this repo is develop my knowledge and experience with iOS development.
