# App Development with Swift (Everyone can Code - Apple)
This repo contains the end of lesson projects I've worked from "App Development with Swift" by Everyone Can Code/Apple.

Each project is the completed project with an added personal extension or stretch goal. I used the lesson projects as a vision and extended it to learn more items that I'm interested in.

Purpose of this repo is develop my knowledge and experience with iOS development.
